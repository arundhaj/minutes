Minutes of Meeting for individuals
===

Yet another web application for taking Minutes of Meeting. If you are puzzled with this point, let me explain. Yes, I too have seen too many web applications that solves this problem. 

I find them complicating the problem even more. Features like signing-up for an account, adding the participants, creating action items and assigning them to the pariticipant, tracking the action items, etc. Is the tool doing more than taking minutes? Moreover, the intended users of these tools is just the meeting-recorder and no other participants. 

Participants, still use their notepad for scribbling their own understanding, thoughts. And this web application is for these individual participants.

Please try the application [here][minutes]
